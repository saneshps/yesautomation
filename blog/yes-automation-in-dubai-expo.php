				  <h1>We are also part of Dubai Expo 2020 - Yes Automation</h1>
	              <img src="../images/blog/yes-automation-in-dubai-expo-2020.jpg" alt="Yes Automation in Dubai Expo" >
	       
        <p>World Expo 2020 is currently hosted by Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 1st October 2021 to 31st March 2022. Expo 2020 was originally scheduled to take place last year from 20th October 2020 to 10th April, 2021, unfortunately it was postponed due to global pandemic. Organizers decided to keep the name Expo 2020 for this event, even though it takes place in 2021, for marketing and branding purposes. Dubai was chosen as the host of this World Expo The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) general assembly in Paris on 27 November 2013.</p>

        <p>The key site of Expo 2020 expands to an area of 438 hectare (1083 acres), which is located between the cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The masterplan for the said event was designed by the American firm HOK. The designed master plan is placed around a central plaza, titled “Al Wasl”, which is enclosed by three large thematic districts. These three thematics represent three sub-themes of Expo 2020 : Opportunity, Mobility and Sustainability. This site also has an emergency center which includes an isolation room, emergency care room, ambulances, and helicopter services around the clock. </p>
        
        <h2>Business Opportunities in Dubai During Expo 2020</h2>
        <p>Unlocking the potential for individuals and communities to shape the future.</p>
        
        <ul>
	              	<li>Tourism</li>
	              </ul>
	   <p>Tourism is one of the most influential domains of business when it comes to Dubai and more over the entire UAE. According to various studies, Expo 2020 is expected to attract over 25 million visitors. Emergence of covid-19 had put the entire expo on hold for over a year now, but with this it is expected to elevate the whole country’s tourism onto the next level. To help out the investors, Dubai Tourism Authority will introduce an easy option to attain a tourism license. </p>
	   
	    <ul>
	              	<li>Hospitality</li>
	              </ul>
	            <p>As the Tourism industry blossoms you would also be able to see a substantial growth in hospitality services. This would mean that starting a hospitality business during the time of Expo 2020 could be a feasible option. With reports estimating over 91,000 hotel rooms available in Dubai right now could easily accommodate the 25 million visitors of the expo. </p>  
	            
	    <ul>
	              	<li>Food & Beverage</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>Without a doubt, it could be considered as an everlasting industry as we just can’t live without food or beverages. But with the emergence of Expo 2020, the entire GCC market is expected to see drastic change in this industry. With the advent of Expo 2020, food service companies would have to provide food for a larger audience. In an event of this magnitude, expo 2020 would have over 200 food & beverage outlets covering an area of over 30,000 spm. So it would be a great time for business investors to start a food business in Dubai. </p>
	   <ul>
	              	<li>Cleaning</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>In an event of this magnitude, the cleaning sector will have to work around the hour to keep the emirates clean during Expo 2020. The Hygiene and modern cleaning industries such as cleaning machines or cleaning robots industries are growing from AED 80 to 300 billion within the span of this year which is 275% growth.</p>
	               <p>With the increase in demand in hotels, exhibition centers, commercial complexes, residential and commercial projects, the cleaning industry is set to see major growth in all facets of this industry. If you are able to acquire the cleaning license from the officials, then it would be a great time and place for investors and entrepreneurs to invest in or to open a cleaning company in Dubai emirates. Many of the cleaning industries choose <a href="https://yesautomation.ae/">YES Automation</a> like <strong>machinery rental companies</strong> to take <a href="https://yesautomation.ae/cleaning-machines.php">cleaning machines for rent</a> during the expo.</p>
	   <ul>
	              	<li>Entertainment</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>WIth the massive gathering of people from across the globe under one emirate, the entire entertainment industry is expected to make a significant change and with that elevating them to the levels of western media.</p>
	              <p>It is estimated that Dubai Theme Park alone is expected to generate over $5 billion. Along with the arrival of Warner Bros. Indoor Amusement park, this industry is expected to grab more than 45 million visitors by 2021. </p>
	   <ul>
	              	<li>SMEs</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>Expo  2020 would be the perfect place for Small and medium entrepreneurs to build relationships with new clients and customers, it could also be considered as an opportunity for them to improve their brand value and find a competitive edge among their peers. Dubai is considered to be the business centre of the world and among all the businesses that exist in Dubai 90% of registered are said to be SMEs. With the arrival of Expo 2020, Dubai SMEs which contribute to 40% of the country's economy will see a drastic growth by the end of 2021. </p>
	              
	   <ul>
	              	<li>Real Estate</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>Dubai expo will most certainly improve and increase the number of businesses across Dubai, but it will indirectly improve and uplift the real estate sector to a great extent. With the arrival of new businesses, the number of commercial and residential complexes are set to increase along with the demand for the same. Real estate in Dubai has demand across the country and globe, so for business investors this could be considered as the perfect timing to set up a real estate business in Dubai. </p>
	              
	   <ul>
	              	<li>Engineering</li>
	              </ul>
	              <p>Dubai has been at the forefront of 21st century engineering with their unique and extravagant style of engineering and architecture. It is not even understatement to say that Dubai stands as the perfect example when it comes to revolutionary engineering. Expo 2020 could be a huge stage for engineering industries to showcase their services and products, and they would also  have high requirements as they are interrelated to other business sectors. </p>
