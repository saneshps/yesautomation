				  <h1>Pressure Washing Wrote Iron? Tips for you</h1>

	              <img src="../images/blog/pressure-washing-wrote-iron-tips-for-you.jpg" alt="Pressure Washing Wrote Iron? Tips for you" >
				  
				  <p>Historically, wrought iron has been an aesthetically pleasing material for almost all indoor and outdoor decor such as flower vases, stare case railings, and door handles. Because of its immense durability, wrought iron has stood the test of time even though it has an affinity to collect dust, smuts, and soot, it can be maintained excellently if painted and cleaned properly. Pressure washing is one of the safest and best ways to clean a wrought iron surface.</p>
				  
				  <h2>What Is the Composition of Wrought Iron?</h2>
				  
				  <p>With its excellent low carbon content, wrought iron is extremely malleable and thanks to this property, people from ancient times started molding it into weapons, helmets, railways, and other infrastructures. It also produces a fibrous and granular texture due to slag, which in turn leads to an exceptional life span.</p>
				  
				  <h2>What are some methods to clean Wrought Iron?</h2>
				  
				  <p>The most commonly followed method from time immemorial is cleaning with a bucket and soap. However, using a brush is always superior (wire brush, to be precise) but there is a catch! If time is a luxury, then this method might not be ideal for you. You can always use a vacuum instead of traditional water, soap, and a sponge, but it depends on the texture of the surface and design, which in turn might affect effective cleaning. A question arises – What about a Pressure Washer? How effective are they in cleaning wrought iron? Is it going to take a lot of my time? The answer to all of these questions is simple. <a href="https://www.yesautomation.ae/pressure-washers.php">Modern Pressure washers</a> are one of the most effective methods to clean your beloved wrought iron surfaces. Why? There are innumerable reasons</p>
				  
				  <ul>

	              	<li><b>1.Safety First</b></li>

	              </ul>
				  <p>Start with a low power to test the surface, and follow the instructions given.</p>
				  
				  <ul>

	              	<li><b>2.Keep the nozzle at a safe distance.</b></li>

	              </ul>
				  
				  <p>You don’t want to make any colossal changes to the surface, do you? Keep it an arm's distance from the surface for best results.</p>
				  
				  <ul>

	              	<li><b>3.Using the right PSI is important</b></li>

	              </ul>
				  
				  <p>1500-2200 PSI must do the trick, anything vastly above this rate might damage your surfaces.</p>
				  
				  <ul>

	              	<li><b>4.Nozzle size</b></li>

	              </ul>
				  
				  <p>Using a strictly narrow nozzle head might not be ideal for these situations because it might conversely help concentrate a high-pressure point on a point, it can be detrimental for iron surfaces.</p>
				  
				  <ul>

	              	<li><b>5.Is Detergent, okay?</b></li>

	              </ul>
				  
				  <p>Yes, a mild detergent helps to even out and break sticky contaminants down that’s on the surface.</p>
				  
				  <ul>

	              	<li><b>6.The Right Angle gives the Right results.</b></li>

	              </ul>
				  
				  <p>For more even cleaning of your wrought iron surfaces, holding the nozzle at an inclined angle is much better than a direct line.</p>
