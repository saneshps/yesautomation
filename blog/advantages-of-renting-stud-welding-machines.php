	              <p>The expansion of industries are happening very rapidly, hence the businesses are continuously on the search for profitable means to efficiently and at the same time effortlessly perform their jobs without compromising on quality. This is where the renting options have become more popular in the Middle East, especially the United Arab Emirates. There is no doubt that renting a stud welding machine is a better thought than purchasing one especially in the case of projects where there is a requirement of studs to be installed.</p>

	              <p>In this blog, we will find out why it is more advantageous to rent a stud welding machine than buying one and how this decision will help your business.</p>

	              <h2>Lessen Your Capital Costs</h2>

	              <p>When you have a stringent budget, investing a big amount of capital in machinery is not a very good idea. With every machine purchase there would always be a clock that starts ticking against the ROI received. It’s common not to have capital amount approved on time and that delays the purchase of machines thereby delaying the project as a whole.</p>

	              <p>At YES Automation, we have a large fleet and you can effortlessly choose the right equipment without having to worry about your ordered equipment arriving late and causing delays for your project.  Renting a machine will help you keep up with the project deadline and without having to worry about any loss due to the project delay.</p>

	              <h2>More Floor Space</h2>

	              <p>It’s very important to have the right machine for each and every job. At the same time, you may have very less space designated for the production and storing of machines. To make things more complicated, there could be scenarios where the right machine that is required for your job doesn’t have the right amount of usage in comparison to other tools. Therefore, you might not have sufficient space to store each and every required welding equipment for your project.</p>

	              <p>Hence renting <a href="https://www.yesautomation.ae/stud-welders.php">stud welding machines </a> will help you with the increasing as well as decreasing demands of that machine in the project and is an efficient way to protect your business during a financial downturn. You have to pay for each and every square meter of your warehouse space and hence it’s to focus on reducing the requirements of more storage space. At the same time, it should also be noted that any machine lying in its storage space without any job is earning nothing. On the other hand, it can cost you for maintenance. Hence like any machine, renting a stud welding machine will allow you to return the machine without having to take the effort of selling a used machine.</p>

	              <h2>Most Modern Stud Welding Machines</h2>

	              <p>The machinery industry is constantly evolving and so is the welding technology. There is no doubt that making use of state-of-the-art welding machines requires continuous effort, you may not have enough time to validate all the functionalities in a limited time. The latest technology stud welding machines will make your job more effective, saves you a considerable amount of time and enhances the quality of welding.</p>

	              <p>Using rental stud welding machines will help you evaluate and understand the pros and cons of the machine. Renting machines will always allow you to combine the latest solutions into your welding jobs for a better period of time in comparison to demonstrations given by the vendors. This will help you identify and understand the productivity and profitability of applications and identify if there are any major hindrances to swiftly achieving the ROI.</p>

	              <h2>Lessen Overhead Costs</h2>

	              <p>Regular maintenance of stud welding machines are very essential for proper performance of the machine and its lifespan. At the same time, it can be a reason for headache as well. In the case of renting stud welding machines, the necessity for upkeep does not completely reduce but it will not be your responsibility completely. At YES Automation, we have a good technical service team to make sure your rented stud welding machines function smoothly.</p>

	              <h2>Flexibility</h2>

	              <p>By taking stud welding machines on rent, you get the flexibility to choose your jobs. Be it you have a requirement for additional stud welding machines to complete a project quickly or during a peak period, you get the opportunity to customize your rental agreements as per your requirements. If you have quick projects or are looking to replace stud welding machines, short term rental works perfect. Long term rentals are ideal for jobs that are in need of complicated welding machines but do not have sufficient budget for purchasing and its maintenance.</p>

	              <h2>Try out Machines</h2>

	              <p>Even though stud welding machines do not come under the most expensive category, working with the machine delivering perfection requires the technician to be trained well. If your business is looking to purchase stud welding machines, it’s important to take the machine on a rental basis for you to try it out and understand the machine before making a purchase. Renting stud welding machines in such cases will allow you to determine whether it's worth purchasing the machines considering many aspects including the return on investment (ROI). </p>
