				  <h1>The Role of Glass Lifters in Sustainable Construction Practices</h1>

	              <img src="../images/blog/the-role-of-glass-lifters-in-sustainable-construction-practices.jpg" alt="The Role of Glass Lifters in Sustainable Construction Practices" >

	              <p>While choosing glass lifters for your construction requirements, it’s imperative to find the most modern lifting equipment that suits the requirements of the latest construction practices as well as the developing environmental concerns. You don’t always need to purchase glass lifters for your short requirements. In such cases, the best practice is to rent one. If you wish to select the right glass lifters for rental for your projects, YES Automation is the right choice for you as we continuously bring the latest and eco friendly technologies to the Middle East region. Through this blog, we will discuss the different types of glass lifters and why they are considered to be eco friendly.</p>

	              <h2>Environmental Friendly Operation</h2>

	              <p>Our glass lifters are well-known for their reliable battery technology.Glass lifters which are powered by batteries are usually harmless to the environment in comparison to the traditional lifting equipment that relies on hydraulic technology or fossil fuels. At construction sites, air quality is enhanced with the use of these lifters that helps in clearing the pollutants raised from the combustion of engines while using batteries that are rechargeable. This procedure is in adherence to the initiatives done globally to lower the carbon footprints and reduce the environmental risk at construction sectors.</p>

	              <h2>Reducing Material Waste and Improving Safety</h2>

	              <p>One of the best ways to reduce material waste resulting from breakage  from the various lifting options, especially during manual handling is the use of glasslifters. Glass lifters, when utilized in lifting fragile sandwich panels, bulky slabs of stone or other very intricate cladding objects offer secure grip and easy transfer of objects without having the fear of falling down or getting broken. The use of glass lifters help you save greatly from the expensive replacements that will be required in case of breakage and also from the significant quantity of wastage that would arise during the course of construction. Making use of glass lifters will pave the way to effective usage of resources.</p>

	              <h2>Lessen the Usage of Hydraulic Fluids:</h2>

	              <p>Conventional hydraulic glass lifting equipment usually depends on hydraulic fluids which can usually be hazardous to our environment. Meanwhile some of the lifters work without relying on hydraulic fluids thereby reducing the potential risk of contaminating water and soil. This stands as a major positive aspect in contributing to a safe, secure and environment friendly jobsite.</p>

	              <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>

	              <p>Apart from having an environmentally friendly power source, <a href="https://www.yesautomation.ae/glass-lifting-sandwich-panel-lifting.php">glass lifters</a> can also help in saving energy while in operation. In comparison to the conventional lifting equipment, glass lifters are designed to work with very less consumption of energy. Usage of power efficiently will allow you to reduce the demands in energy consumption on construction sites thereby helping you to lower the expense involved in operation as well as any impacts in the environment related to consumption of energy.</p>
	              <h2>Flexible Operation</h2>

	              <p>At <a href="https://www.yesautomation.ae">YES Automation</a>, you can find a wide range of glass lifters that are available to rent suitable for lifting glass, cladding as well as stone. Our glass lifting equipment are flexible, have the capability to adapt to various construction requirements from fixing huge glass windows in huge buildings to accurately keeping ornamental stone components in architectural designs. This flexibility improves the efficiency of operation at the same time making sure that each and every material is taken care with accuracy, thereby lowering the environmental effects of construction projects.</p>
	              <h2>Conclusion On The Role of Glass Lifters in Sustainable Construction Practices</h2>

	              <p>Glass lifters are inevitable when it comes to businesses related to glass panels. Utilizing glass lifters come with several benefits like enhanced efficiency, improved safety and security as well as flexibility. Having a good understanding of how glass lifters work and the different models of them available and the points to consider while choosing to rent the right glass lifter, companies can make profitable decisions in order to maximise their output.</p>

	              <p>Always remember to keep safety in priority during the usage of glass lifters and adhere to the upkeep practices as directed by the manufacturer to ensure a long life span and maximum output. Utilizing glass lifters in your construction projects can help you simplify your operations and lessen the possibility of accidents and attain excellent results.  Hence, whichever industry you are from - construction or manufacturing or any other industry, make use of glass lifters to your workflow and get the experience of a great transformation that you will see in safety and efficiency.</p>
