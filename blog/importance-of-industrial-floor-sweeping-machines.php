	              <img src="../images/blog/importance-of-industrial-floor-sweeping-machines.jpg" alt="Floor Sweeping Machines" >

	              <p>Industrial Floor Sweeping machines are wheeled machines that mechanically and swiftly let you remove debris,dust and coarse dirt from different types of floorings.An industrial sweeping machine removes the non adherent dirt by the action of rotating brushes or through the combined effect of brushes and vacuum cleaners which gets collected in a debris hooper.</p>

	              <p>These sweeping machines are also known as floor sweepers.Floor sweeping machine is an essential tool for professional floor cleaning for both indoor and outdoor spaces.The industrial <a href="https://www.yesautomation.ae/sweeper-machines.php">Floor Sweeping Machines</a> are commonly used in industries, gas stations, warehouses, cleaning of pavements and streets and public spaces.It is used to remove free debris from the floors like small stones, leaves, small solid debris and dust of various sizes.</p>

	              <h2>Types of Industrial Sweeping Machines</h2>

	              <p>Industrial sweeping machines can be categorised depending on the type of power supply, the type of traction and the type of load.</p>

	              <h2>The Type of Power Supply</h2>

	              <p>Based on the power supply they are differentiated into:</p>

	              <h3>a.Motorised sweepers</h3>

	              <p>Motorised sweepers are powered by the internal combustion engines that run on petrol, diesel or liquid petroleum gas.They are highly efficient machine when it comes to the performance, therefore they are used mainly for cleaning outdoors.However, hybrid versions are also available that combine petrol engine with an electric unit attached to battery pack, which increases the working runtime with reduced power consumption.</p>

	              <h3>b.Battery Powered Sweepers</h3>

	              <p>Battery powered sweepers incorporate different types of batteries such as lead acid,AGM/gel or lithium ion.They come with the salient features of being silent and eco-friendly, which makes them an ideal choice of indoor cleaning.At the same time, they can also be used for outdoor environments due to the remarkable reduction in CO2 emission.</p>

	              <h2>The type of traction</h2>

	              <p>Based on the type of traction they categorised into:</p>

	              <h3>a.Walk-Behind Sweepers</h3>

	              <h3>b.Ride-on Sweepers</h3>

	              <p>They have a characteristic wide cleaning track and a higher filtration capacity.Therefore they provide greater coverage and speed which makes them ideal for industries, parking lots, warehouses etc.They  can be used indoor and outdoors with medium to large areas.They have comfortable seating and easy controls, which makes them very convenient and efficient.</p>

	              <h2>The Type of Load</h2>

	              <p>Based on the type of load they are distinguished into:</p>

	              <h3>a.Front Loading Sweepers</h3>

	              <p>The front loading sweepers work on broom-dustpan principle.The central brush will move the dirt forward into the waste container which is situated at the front of the sweeper.They are used in heavy industries for collecting heavy dirt.</p>

	              <h3>b.Rear Loading Sweepers</h3>

	              <p>The rear loading sweepers, as the name suggests have central brush which moves the dirt backwards into the waste container which is situated at the rear of the sweeper.These machines are agile and easy to manoeuvre that are capable of collecting large quantities of light waste, which makes them ideal for commercial areas. </p>

	              <h2>Benefits of using Floor Sweeping Machines</h2>

	              <h3>1.Swift Cleaning</h3>
